# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains information about passengers such as age, gender, class, and other relevant features.

## Project Overview
1. Data Cleaning: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the data.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations and statistical analysis are performed to gain insights into the relationships between different variables and the survival outcome.
3. Feature Engineering: New features are created from the existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model.
4. Model Training: Several machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, are trained on the dataset.
5. Model Evaluation: The performance of each model is assessed using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Hyperparameter Tuning: The models are fine-tuned by adjusting their hyperparameters to improve their performance.
7. Final Model Selection: The best-performing model is selected based on the evaluation results.
8. Deployment: The final model is deployed to make predictions on new, unseen data.
